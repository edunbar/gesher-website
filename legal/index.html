	discretion of the existing board of directors. Applications for board will
	be open  at the discretion of the board, but should be opened within a

	position from the application pool.

	the active members must be present at the meeting. These two candidates for
	each position will then give a speech to the entire group, maximum of five
	minutes. After the two candidates give their speech, voting will take place

	allowed. The board will announce potential members to elect when elections
	take place, and will give those running reasonable time to prepare a

	eligible to run, including former and existing directors of the board of
	directors. The same rules apply as for general elections, with the exception
	of the time that an election must take place.

	respective incumbent director, with the intent to learn how to best fulfill
	their roles and responsibilities for approximately two weeks.
	<br><br>
	Responsibilities and roles are transferred at the board meeting occurring

	immediately.

	Gesher Group shall provide its Internal Revenue forms 990, 990-T, 1023 and 5227, bylaws, conflict of interest policy, and financial statements to the general public for inspection free of charge, available at geshergroup.org/legal.

	<br><br><strong>9.03   Means and Conditions of Disclosure</strong>

Additionally, no effort should be made to hide or obscure the location or availability of these documents.

	<br><br><strong>9.04 IRS Annual Information Returns (Form 990)</strong>
	Gesher Group shall submit the Form 990 to its Board of Directors prior to the filing of the Form 990. While neither the approval of the Form 990 or a review of the 990 is required under Federal law, Gesher Group’s Form 990 shall be submitted to each member of the Board of Directors via hard copy or email at least 10 days (regular, not business) before the Form 990 is filed with the IRS.

	<br><br><strong>9.05 Board</strong>
	All board deliberations shall be made open to members of Gesher Group in the form of minutes, except where the board passes a motion to make any specific portion confidential. This should also include any relevant papers or materials that were included in the discussion by the board, unless the board passes a motion to make any specific portion confidential.

	<br><br><strong>9.06 Member Records</strong>
	All member records, such as meeting notes or attendance documents, shall be made available to the Gesher Group member body, while maintaining privacy for individuals outside of the organization. We strive to maintain transparency, but also recognize that some information (such as phone number, date of birth, financial records) should be kept private by those entrusted to such information (read: the Board of Directors), unless explicitly stated by the owner and originator of such information.

	<br><br><strong>9.07 Donor/Client Records</strong>
	Donor or client records shall be made available by request to any members of Gesher Group, or legal representatives of Gesher Group. No donor or client records shall be made available to members outside of the organization, and some private information shall be kept private by donor/client request. We default to transparency, but as in 11.06, recognize that some information should be kept private. Donor/client records shall be made available to the Board of Directors.


	<h2>Article X. Miscellaneous</h2>

	<br><br><strong>10.01 Conflict of Interest</strong>

	or member of a committee with board-delegated powers.


	<h2>Article XI. Amendments</h2>

	These Bylaws may be amended, altered, repealed, or restated for further
	clarification by a vote from two-thirds majority of the currently enrolled

	board announcements. However,
	<br><br>
	<i>(a) Voting Rights.</i> No amendment shall be made to these Bylaws that will cause Gesher Group’s board of directors’ and members’ voting rights to be affected (voting rights requires majority of votes and two-thirds of quorum is met).
