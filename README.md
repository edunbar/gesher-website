## What's this?
Since starting to run a D&D5e game, I've found a lack of beautiful, highly useful, and relevant tools for game administration. I want Superintendent to be that. From this, you can expect tools to aid in creating and managing NPCs, maps, quests, and more.

## Installation instructions
1. Make sure you have Ruby installed. If not, get Ruby [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn run build`
4. Go to http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Making edits
Check out the `assets` folder, _don't touch anything in `/css`_, it's all autogenerated code. Don't touch the CNAME file, or now.json unless you know what you're doing.

If you want to edit a page, edit the HTML. Jekyll uses a templating language called Liquid, which you can read about [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/).

Make sure you adhere to the style guide before committing. To check and make sure your code is passing, run `yarn run test`. If you use Atom (you should, [download here](http://atom.io)), you can download the `linter-js-standard` package, available [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/).
